# Churn_Prediction_Project

Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave or cancel a service subscription.

In this Project, a model is created which will be used in Predicting churn which is a good way to develop proactive marketing campaigns targeted at the customers that are about to churn and will tell the service provider whether the churn will cancel a subscription or not.

This project is done with the help of several Machine Learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and many more.

The dataset which is used for this project is "churn_prediction" which will also be provided.

There were several variables of different datatypes so each of them was separated and observed.

The Numerical and Categorical Variables were both treated separately in order to prepare them for the model building.

Several Graphs have been plotted between several variables to show and find the correlation between them and decide how much will affect the target variable and will they affect the accuracy of our model.

The missing values as well as the outliers were also treated as they would have affected the accuracy and predictive value of our final model.

Further on Model was built with the help of *Logistic Regression* which was imported from sklearn.

In the end, the Model was regulated and Accuracy was calculated which came out to more than 80 per cent for both the training and testing set which shows that our Model that was created with Logistic Regression works well.

This project included several concepts of Machine Learning such as Data preprocessing, Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Regulation.
